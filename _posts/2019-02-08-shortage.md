Westpac expects housing values to be “resilient”
over the next 3-5 years, notwithstanding evidence of
decline in some markets in Sydney and Melbourne.

The bank’s chief executive Brian Hartzer says
the slowdown in property values in Sydney and
Melbourne has been “orderly” so far, and he says a
shortage of housing stock, compared with a growing
population, will ultimately mean that housing values
will remain resilient.

Westpac, the country’s biggest lender to landlords,
says it expects demand for loans from property
investors to remain “weak,” but first-home buyers
are stepping into the housing market in increasing
numbers.

“From a housing market point of view, although
we’ve seen some prices come down, we view it as
the first steps in an orderly slowdown,” he says. “So
we think prices will come down a little bit more from
here, but we don’t expect a big drop in house prices.
“They’ve had the biggest run-up over time, so it’s not
surprising that they’re coming back a bit.”
