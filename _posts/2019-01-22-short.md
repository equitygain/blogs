Short-stay rental operators have won a legal victory amid growing
pressure for industry regulation. An apartment owner in the Melbourne suburb of Doncaster, who
flouted rules aimed at stopping short-term stays, has been given the
all-clear after he challenged the building’s owners corporation in the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

Zheng Sheng Lim, who co-owns an apartment in the Imperial building
at Sovereign Point Court, Doncaster, challenged rules banning short-
term stays. The owners’ corporation had deactivated a security key
fobs for the building after accusing the owner of repeated breaches of
the rules.

However, after the matter was brought to VCAT the owners corporation admitted special rules it had
registered to stop short-term tenancies were “probably invalid”, documents show.
VCAT ruled the owners’ corporation did not have the right to deactivate security fobs or restrict tenant
access to the building, except in emergencies. Airbnb Australian head of public policy Brent Thomas says
the case validated past rulings around the country.
