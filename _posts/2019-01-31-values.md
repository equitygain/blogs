Half of Australia has recorded a rise in dwelling values
over the past year, new analysis shows, contrary to
headlines claiming prices are falling across the nation.
According to CoreLogic, around half of the SA4 sub-
regions (the ABS divides Australia into 88 sub-regions for
data collection) have recorded a rise in property values.

“<i>With housing values falling in some of the capital city
markets, it’s easy to forget there are some markets
around the country that are actually seeing healthy and
sustainable growth conditions</i>,” says CoreLogic’s Tim
Lawless.

Many regions have recorded a rate of capital gain
higher than their five-year average rate. Regional areas
are much more likely to be showing positive growth
conditions, with 57% of all regional areas recording an
annual rise in values in the past 12 months, compared
to only 39% of the capital city regions.

But some capital cities are also showing rising values
as well, including seven of Brisbane’s nine sub-regions,
three of the four sub-regions in Adelaide and four of
Melbourne’s nine regions.
