Most banks don’t reward loyalty so customers need to
haggle for a better mortgage rate or miss out on $850
a year in savings, the ACCC’s latest inquiry has found.

The ACCC Residential Price Inquiry has found that “only
11% of borrowers with variable rate mortgages had the
price of their current residential mortgage reduced by
one of the five banks under review in FY2018”.

It found banks were generally not rewarding loyal
customers, but instead offering bigger discounts to
new customers coming on board.
“An existing borrower with an average-sized mortgage
could initially save up to $850 a year in interest if they
negotiated to pay the same interest rate as the average
new borrower,” the ACCC report says. “For many
borrowers the gain will be much larger.”

And it found that part of the reason for such a small
take-up — and why banks have not moved to reward
existing customers as much — was that it was hard to
get information on better rates, let alone change deals.
