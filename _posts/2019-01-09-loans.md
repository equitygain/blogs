The banks are easing their squeeze on new mortgages
with new loans to investors rising in October for the
first time since February, alongside an increase in
loans to owner-occupiers.

The proportion of first-home buyers in the home loan market rose to
18.1%, a six-year high. There was a 2.3% rise in new
mortgage approvals in October, following falls in
the previous two months. The October rise was the
strongest growth rate since July 2017.

Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan says
the previous weakness in loan approvals may have
related to processing delays as lenders apply more
rigorous assessments. Loan approvals rose in all
states except WA, which suggests an easing in new
mortgage supply bottlenecks.

In annual terms, loans in total are down 4.8%, mainly
due to the investor drop-off. But CommSec senior
economist Ryan Felsman says first-home buyers
continue to be very active.

“The average home-loan size lifted in October, suggesting some buyers are
still gaining access to sizeable loans, despite tighter
lending standards,” he says.
