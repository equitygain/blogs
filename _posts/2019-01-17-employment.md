High employment is the key factor in keeping Australian
property markets strong in the face of price decline in
Sydney and Melbourne, according to lender <strong>Bankwest</strong>.
Bankwest managing director Rowan Munchenberg
says that provided employment continues to be as
strong as it is, the price correction in the biggest cities
will not create problems.

<em>“Employment still remains high and while that is the
case, despite flat wage growth, it will be the key for
economic prosperity and the ability for people to pay
off their debt,” he says. “While unemployment remains
low we are in a good place</em>.

<em>“Internally we plan for multiple scenarios around what’s
happening in the marketplace and what’s happening
with house prices whether it be further decline, being
level or some increases. We’re not seeing any evidence
of anything falling off a cliff.</em>”

Munchenberg says the bank, like the rest of the sector,
has reined in investor lending due to APRA regulations.
<em>“That has had a pricing effect and a demand dampening
effect across the industry,”</em> he says.
