The housing downturn in the two biggest cities, plus
government incentives, are creating new opportunities
for first-home buyers. New ABS data shows that the
market share of first-home buyers is now at its highest
level in seven years.

Overall the value of new housing
loans dropped 2.5% in November and was 16% below
the level of a year ago, which was close to the market
peak, but loans to FHBs continued to rise. The ABS
report shows the value of lending to investors nationally
dropped 4.5% to $9.3 billion, the lowest level in six
years and down almost 30% from the peak reached in
early 2017.

But in some states investor loans are still
rising, notably in Queensland and South Australia.
Owner-occupiers upgrading their homes arranged
$10.1 billion in mortgage commitments in November,
down 3.1% from the previous month and 17% below
the peak in the middle of last year.

The fall in the Sydney and Melbourne markets, together
with state government tax breaks, is encouraging a lift
in purchases from first-home buyers, whose share of
housing finance has risen to 18.3%.
