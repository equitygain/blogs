Sydney and Melbourne housing markets are “on track for a soft landing”. Long span of economic growth, 27 consecutive years, is likely to continue. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says Australia’s long span of economic growth, 27 consecutive years, is likely to continue.

In its latest Australian economic survey, the OECD says:
“Life is good, with high levels of well-being, including
health and education. Robust economic growth is set
to continue. “New capacity coming on stream in the
resources sector will support exports and business
investment will pick up. Growth of wages and prices
will rise gradually, while the unemployment rate will
edge lower.”

The OECD says the most likely outcome for the housing
market in the biggest cities is a soft landing and that
a housing crash is unlikely. But it says the housing
market could pose a risk to the nation’s economic
growth going forward. “Financial supervisors and bank
regulators should be prepared in the event of a hard
landing in the housing market,” the report says. “High
indebtedness of households remains a risk.”
