APRA’s latest quarterly banking statistics suggest
borrowers are avoiding major banks due to lack of
trust and are instead seeking out smaller lending
organisations.

The Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority’s quarterly figures reveal that housing loan
growth among non-major lenders is outpacing that of
the big four banks.

Growth in housing loan approvals among smaller
lenders increased 4.1% year-on-year, compared to a
3.6% rise among major lenders.

According to CEO of the Customer Owned Banking
Association (COBA) Michael Lawrence, the data
reflects the diminished trust in major banks following
the recent scrutiny from the financial services royal
commission. “<i>Given the damage to the reputation of
the broader banking sector, customers are looking for
banking institutions they can trust</i>,” Lawrence says.

APRA’s statistics also show that total assets in the
customer-owned banking sector have surpassed $113
billion and the sector’s total housing loans reached
nearly $85 billion.
