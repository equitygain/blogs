Price data from leading industry website realestate.
com.au shows market conditions across Australia are
highly variable and generally present a positive outlook
for the market.

The realestate.com.au numbers show that Hobart has
continued to out-perform, with prices rising 8.4% in
the past year. It records annual house price decline of
5.9% in Sydney and 1.5% in Melbourne, considerably
less than the rate of decline claimed by CoreLogic.

Adelaide prices rose 1.1% on average but its high rate
of views per listing – 1257 – reflects a market in strong
demand, says realestate.com.au chief economist
Nerida Conisbee .

She says tighter lending and negative sentiment have
caused lower house prices in some cities, but she
expects the low jobless rate to help the biggest cities
ride out the downturn.

<em>“We’re not seeing the big jumps in listings that are typical of a price crash,” Conisbee
says. She says APRA winding back the cap on interest-
only loans in December was the first sign it will get
easier to borrow</em>.
