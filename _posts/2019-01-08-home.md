Home renovations have hit a record high, sealing
2018 as the Year of the Reno for Aussie families.
Latest ABS data shows that private investment in
alterations and additions reached to a historic high
of $9.896 billion in the September Quarter, 11%
higher than a year ago.

“Australia’s home renovations sector enjoyed its
busiest quarter in 14 years during the three months
to September 2018,” says MBA Chief Economist
Shane Garrett.

He says all signs are pointing to this figure rising
further, with many families deciding to renovate their
existing home rather than relocate to new ones.
“Australia’s home renovations industry may be
an unintended beneficiary of the tougher lending
policies,” he says.

“Looking further out, we are almost certain to see
further gains for home renovations. More detached
houses were built in late 1980s Australia than at any time
before or since. More and more of these will be begging
for major renovations work in the coming years.”
