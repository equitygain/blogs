Almost 10,500 first-home buyers took out a home loan
in November, just off the highest number in nine years,
according to CommSec chief economist Craig James.

The proportion of first-time buyers in the home loan
market rose to 18.3%, the highest level in six years.
“<i>Clearly these buyers are celebrating the greater
choice of properties on the market, more attractive
prices and super-low interest rates</i>,” says James.

James says too much focus is placed on Sydney and
Melbourne when housing markets in many other parts
of the country are doing well.

Over the year to November, almost $238 billion in loans
were taken up by owner-occupiers, just below the all-
time high of $240 billion in the year to August.
“<i>While investors have retreated from the market,
budding home owners are still out in force</i>,” he says.

“The number of owner-occupier home loan borrowers in
Tasmania stands at 61⁄2-year highs, with ACT borrowers
at record highs, South Australian borrowers are at
18-month highs and WA borrowers at 10-month highs.”
