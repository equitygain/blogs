The Federal Government will go into this year’s election campaign
riding the strongest jobs market in seven years, with new figures
showing unemployment falling and giving a boost to cash-strapped
households.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the jobless rate edged
down to 5% in December after the creation of 21,600 jobs.
Victoria’s jobless rate fell to 4.2%, its lowest level since the ABS
started measuring unemployment on a monthly basis in 1978. In
NSW, unemployment edged down to 4.3%, its lowest level since
before the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.

WA’s unemployment rate is the highest in the nation at 6.3% while it is 6.1% in Queensland and 5.9% in both
Tasmania and South Australia.
A strong employment market is seen by many analysts as the key to underpinning real estate markets around
the nation. The overall tight jobs market is still to translate into strong wages growth. When unemployment
last averaged 5%, the wage price index was at 3.6%.
