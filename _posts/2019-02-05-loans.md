Will Commissioner Kenneth Hayne's final report find home buyers all over the country harder to get loans?

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg doesn't think so. He believed that the result would benefit consumers as a whole. The said reform would strive financial institutions to reach a higher standard of conduct.


Property Council chief Ken Morrison also finds positive outcome. Though he believed law makers will seek to fix the banks they should not break the economy.

Mr Morrison saw significant changes for the mortgage broking sector, this would reflect the residential property industry. Mortgage brokers secured half of all property loans being settled. Australian property buyers and investor will benefit the importance of advise and competitive finance from the mortgage broking sector.
