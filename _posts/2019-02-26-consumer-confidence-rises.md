Consumer sentiment has improved, with economists
attributing the rebound to a change in views on interest
rates, with most people now expecting rates to remain
on hold or fall.

The widely watched monthly Westpac-Melbourne
Institute survey showed a 4.3% rise in confidence back
to 103.8 in February, after it had dipped in January.
Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan says the
improved mood is largely due to a shift in stance on
interest rates by the Reserve Bank.

Less than 43% of
Australians now believe that interest rates will rise
over the next year, down from about half in August.
Hassan says there’s no sign so far in Westpac’s survey
that price declines in the Sydney and Melbourne
housing markets are were causing alarm.

“Confidence continues to bear up well,” he says.
“The continued house-price correction, concentrated
in Sydney and Melbourne, is impacting consumer
expectations for prices but so far appears to be having
only limited spill-over effects on wider confidence.”
