Clamps on mortgage lending imposed on the banks
in recent years could be loosened as an alternative
to cutting interest rates, leading market analysts
have predicted.

As markets bet there is a 50-50
chance the next move in official interest rates will be
a cut, some experts say there is also room for APRA
to take action to ease “macroprudential” policy.
APRA helped slow the $1.6 trillion home loan market
in recent years by capping lending to investors and
customers with interest-only loans, and forcing
banks to more thoroughly vet customers.

In December, however, the Council of Financial
Regulators, which includes APRA and the RBA,
raised concerns banks were being “overly cautious”
in their lending decisions. APRA has also scrapped
a limit on interest-only loans (from 1 January), after
also axing a cap on loans to investors earlier in 2018.

Macquarie economists Justin Fabo and Ric Deverell
predict APRA will further loosen curbs on the
mortgage market. One possible change is to lower
the 7% minimum interest rate at which banks are
required to test all new customers (much higher
than actual interest rates).
