The Reserve Bank of Australia kept the official
interest on hold this week but a reduction in the
cash rate seems more likely now than it has in years,
according to comparison site Finder.

All 28 experts in Finder’s RBA cash rate survey
correctly predicted that the RBA would hold at 1.50%
on Tuesday, but their predictions have changed
dramatically about the direction of the next RBA move.

For the past two years, about 80% of experts have
predicted an increase as the next cash rate move by the
RBA. But this month, only 11 of the 28 experts did so.
Stephen Koukoulas, managing director at Market
Economics, says he could see a change happen as
soon as next month.

 “The RBA will acknowledge the
economy is weaker than when it last met and will
signal a change in bias towards an easing,” he says.
Graham Cooke, insights manager at Finder, says the
panellists who put a date on their rate drop predictions
were evenly spread from March to November.
