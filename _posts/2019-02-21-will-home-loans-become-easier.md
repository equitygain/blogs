The Royal Commissions' recommendation may affect home loan in a positive way.
According to one of the big four banks home loans will be bit easier.

As for the banks need to make some tightening measures he believes that they have been gone
though the process. This also reflects the report from the Royal Commission. Implementing all the stpes that they've got in place have more ways to go further.

He says itâ€™s highly unlikely there will be any more
shocks. Home buyers will expect a healthy competition among lenders.
This will benefit potential property investors as well.

He thinks some relaxation perhaps in criteria as the banks will consider about what to do with investor only
loans. As far as the regulator goes, they have made it clear not to see any measures for further tightening.
This concludes that credit constraints will ease up to the benefit of property investor or first home buyers.
