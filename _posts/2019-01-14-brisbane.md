Brisbane’s recovering apartment market is set to lead the nation
over the next two years.

With values forecast to grow more than in
any other major capital city.

Moody’s Analytics expects apartments to outperform houses
throughout Greater Brisbane in 2019. It predicts apartment values will grow 2.8% in 2019, followed by
sharper growth of 6.5% the following year – a performance equalled
only by Darwin among the capital cities.

In terms of specific sub-markets, a rise in unit values of more than
7% is expected in the inner city, Logan City and Moreton Bay regions
in 2019.

House values are tipped to grow the most in Brisbane’s western suburbs this year (4.5%).
Moody’s Analytics is forecasting a 6% correction in house values in Melbourne this year, while Sydney house
values are expected to fall a further 3.3% in 2019 following a 5.2% drop last year.
The report says the cooling trend in the biggest cities in the final months of 2018 saw a sharper decline in
house values than for apartment values.
