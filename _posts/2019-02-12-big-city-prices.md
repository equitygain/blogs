CommSec chief economist Craig James says prices
in Sydney and Melbourne remain 40-50% higher than
the levels of 2012, despite recent falls.

James says prices in the two biggest cities are
retreating to “fair value” but just where that lies for
home prices “remains to be seen”.

James notes that Sydney and Melbourne home prices
are still well above the August 2012 lows. Sydney
dwelling prices are up 50% from their August 2012
levels, while Melbourne prices are 44% higher.

“The good news in the NSW and Victorian markets
is that the unwinding of unsustainably high prices is
occurring at a time when job markets are in the best
shape in 40 years,” James says.

CommSec says that, meanwhile, Hobart is up 40%,
Canberra is up 23% and Brisbane and Adelaide prices
are both up by around 20%.
Perth and Darwin prices have been hit by the ending
of the resources boom over this period, James says.
