The Banking Royal Commission report proves that
even within regulated environments lawlessness
can be rife, says Property Investment Professionals
of Australia.

PIPA chairman Peter Koulizos says the many
examples of criminal activity in the financial services
sector was a sign of what happens when money is
more important than client outcomes.

“The report suggests many in the sector were
motivated by greed rather than acting in their
client’s best interests,” he says. “However, such a
blanket statement does a disservice to the majority
of honest employees working in the industry.

“Mortgage brokers, for example, create much-
needed competition and deserve to be paid for their
service, so we’re pleased the Federal Government has
questioned the recommendation that commissions
be paid by consumers rather than banks.”

The PIPA Investor Sentiment Survey found 75% of
investors secured their last investment loan through
a mortgage broker and 86% intend to finance their
next loan through a broker.
