Amid the negative media about the Melbourne
housing market, the city’s median sale price actually
rose last year, according to the Real Estate Institute
of Victoria.

It says Melbourne’s house median rose 1.4% from
$815,000 in 2017 to $826,500 in 2018. The figure was
pulled up by booming outer suburbs like Mt Martha
and Cranbourne North.

Melbourne’s unit median
also increased – up 1.8% to $597,000.
REIV president Robyn Waters says despite sluggish
clearance rates, a 20% drop in sales and low
confidence, vendors who sold homes achieved good
prices in 2018.

<i>“It might take you a bit longer to sell and you might
have to put in a bit more effort,” she says. “But the
big picture is showing house prices have increased
slightly.”</i>

Other research sources have different numbers for
Melbourne house prices in 2018 – the realestate.
com.au website says they fell 1.9%, while both
Domain and SQM Research record a 3% decline.
CoreLogic claimed a 9% decrease, a figure out of
step with all other research sources.
