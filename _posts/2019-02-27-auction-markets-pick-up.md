Capital city auction markets are strengthening, with
week-on-week increases in auction volumes and
Sydney recording its first clearance rate above 60%
since last July.

There were 521 auctions in Sydney
last weekend, with results showing a 61% preliminary
clearance rate — a big improvement on the 54% rate
from 322 auctions the previous week.

“We are starting to see more positive signs in Sydney,”
says REA Group chief economist Nerida Conisbee.
“The market is holding up much better than we
thought. Typically, markets are much slower to gain
momentum at the start of the year.

This time last year
Sydney’s market was a lot weaker. So this result is
highly unusual, particularly given the negativity we’re
hearing about the market in commentary.”

Melbourne continued to be the busiest city market,
with 657 auctions last week and a clearance rate of
54% - up from 350 auctions the previous week when a
rate of 52% was posted.

Adelaide was the best performing capital city market
last week with a clearance rate of 67% across 83
auctions. Canberra held 52 auctions with a clearance
rate of 48%.
