Commonwealth Bank CEO Matt Comyn doesn’t
expect house prices to fall much this year and has
expressed confidence in the health of the economy
and the availability of credit.

Having reported an interim profit of $4.77 billion for
the nation’s biggest home lender, Comyn suggests
housing credit will probably slow as demand remains
weak - but house prices will not rapidly fall.

“I certainly do not subscribe to the theory that there
is going to be a rapid acceleration in downward
pressure on house prices,” he says, noting that even
with a decline in Sydney, house prices remain 60%
higher than five years ago.

Comyn’s comments align with those of Reserve
Bank governor Philip Lowe on an orderly correction
in the housing market.

Lowe says: “Importantly, unlike most other housing
price corrections, this one has not been associated
with rising unemployment or higher interest rates.
Instead, mainly structural factors, relating to the
underlying balance of supply and demand, in our
largest cities have been at work.”
