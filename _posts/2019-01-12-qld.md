A stronger housing market and improving job
prospects has helped net migration levels to
Queensland overtake Victoria.According to a report from real estate group CBRE.
Victoria was Australia’s most popular state to move
to from 2013 to 2017.

The trend was supported by the state’s strong economy and buoyant jobs
market, with an average of 14,000 people per annum
making the change. But population growth eased in
FY2018, with falls in both net interstate and overseas
migration figures.

Deloitte Access Economics says that over the next
five years the Queensland economy is expected to
grow 3.6%, outpacing the 3% growth predicted in
NSW and Victoria.

In Sydney and Melbourne, people are being turned
off by the spike in property prices over the five years
to 2018. CBRE associate director Craig Godber
says the housing market will continue to support
migration to Queensland. “It has only been since
the price differential between Sydney and Brisbane
approached its widest point in early 2017 that a
clear upward trend in net interstate migration to
Queensland emerged,” says Godber.
