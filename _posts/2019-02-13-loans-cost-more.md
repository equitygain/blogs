Australia’s mortgage broking industry has criticised
the Banking Royal Commission report, saying a
move to overhaul how brokers are paid will make
loans more expensive by entrenching the power of
major lenders.

The Finance Brokers Association of Australia says
the Royal Commission had fundamentally failed to
understand the role mortgage brokers play and the
competitiveness they bring to the home loan market.

The sector, which accounts for 60% of all home loans,
is gearing up to fight a key recommendation in the
final report from Kenneth Hayne: that borrowers,
not lenders, should pay brokers.

“Hayne wants to hand even more power to the
big banks and eliminate competition, which is a
ridiculous scenario and shows just how out of touch
he is when it comes to brokers,” Finance Brokers
Association managing director Peter White says.
“We know that most borrowers wouldn’t pay and
banks would make more money and standards
would drop further.”
