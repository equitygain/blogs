Six of the eight capital cities delivered
growth in their rentals in 2018, both for houses and
for apartments. The Domain Rental Report shows that rents are
stronger than sale prices in terms of growth in the
past year.

There is, as always, a strong correlation between
vacancy rates and rental growth. The cities with the tightest rental markets, Hobart
and Canberra, are the ones with the highest annual
growth in their rentals.

Canberra now has the highest
average house rents in the nation, up 3.7% to $560
per week, having overtaken Sydney when average
rents have fallen.

Other cities with low vacancies, Adelaide and
Melbourne, have also recorded solid growth in their
rentals.

Two cities where vacancy rates have been high in the
recent past but have improved recently - Brisbane
and Perth - are also both delivering moderate growth
in their rents â€“ around 2-3% in 2018.

The only cities where rents have fallen in the past
year are those where vacancies are trending higher Sydney and Darwin.
