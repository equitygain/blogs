The Reserve Bank of Australia may ignore the official
interest rate to its lowest level since the 1950s, just
months out from the Federal Election.

In a shift that saw the Australian dollar fall that forced
financial markets to price in an interest rate cut. RBA
governor Philip Lowe has used a major address to concede
cash-strapped consumers and a slowing property market
in some cities posed risks to the economy.

For the past year the RBA has signalled the next move in
the cash rate - currently at a near-record low 1.5% - would
be up, given a strong jobs market and solid economy.
But the failure of low unemployment to lift wages
significantly and signs consumers are spending less
has made the RBA to lower its forecasts for the
economy.

Armed with important new inflation figures to be
released in late April, the RBA board will meet on 7 May
just couple of days before federal election widely expected
to be held on 11 May or 18 May.
Lowe says much will hinge on the strength of the jobs
market, with unemployment now at 5%.
