Equity Gain Pty Ltd originally based in Melbourne has now expanded to all the capital cities around Australia. At Equity Gain we will assist you to save tax, pay off your home faster and create wealth for a quality retirement. With Australian property prices doubling on average every 7-10 years, the benefits of property investment are well known.

Add to this the shortage of quality rental property in our major cities and surrounding suburbs and you can see that there's never been a better time to invest in property than right now. Many clients tell us that the reasons they haven't invested in property relate to lack of time and lack of knowledge about property investments.

It takes time and specific knowledge to conduct research, inspect properties, organize finance, and deal with solicitors, quantity surveyors, accountants, property managers, and so on. Equity Gain does all of this for you. We have a team of fully qualified professionals in all of these areas who make it easy for you to develop your own property portfolio. All you have to do is sit back and watch your investment grow with Equity Gain.
