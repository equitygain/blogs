Tasmania’s property market has reached new
heights and broken records — again. For the first
time, over $4 billion worth of property was sold in
the state in a calendar year.

In the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania’s 2018
review, it was revealed that property worth $4.067
billion was sold — 5% more than the previous record-
breaking year.

At the top end of the market, 181 properties were
sold above $1 million, most of which were bought by
Tasmanians. Activity in the first home-buyer sector
increased by almost 20%.

Overall, purchasers from interstate bought 2,348
properties, about 20% of all transactions.
Last year was the seventh in a row and the 14th out
of 15 years where Tasmania set a new benchmark
for the number of residential transactions.

At 11,394 in 2018, it was just 41 sales more than 2017.
REIT president Tony Collidge says that, with the
state of the market and demand still high, there is
“currently no end in sight” for the current property
cycle. “I can’t see anything in the near future that
will change things for our market,” he says.
