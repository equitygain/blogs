Australia’s home-building boom continues to improve
affordability, according to HIA Senior Economist
Geordan Murray. Affordability in six of the eight capital
cities is now better than the 20-year average.

The HIA Affordability Index for the capital cities registered 75.4 in
the December Quarter. This is 1.5% higher than in the
previous quarter and 3.3% higher than a year earlier.
<i>“2018 was the fifth consecutive year where the industry
started construction of over 200,000 homes and it was
a record year for new dwelling completions,” Murray
says.</i>

“This strong flow of new housing supply is one
of the key factors behind the moderation in price
pressures in housing markets, which has ultimately
improved housing affordability.”

Another key factor is the modest improvement in wages.
Strong growth in employment in the last two years has
boosted demand for workers. <i>“We are seeing the early
signs that this is translating into rising wages,”</i> he says.

The combination of those factors and low interest rates
creates a situation where affordability in most capital
cities is more favourable than the 20-year average.
