Vacancies remain tight in most capital cities, despite
seasonal rises in vacancies in December, according
to the latest data from SQM Research. Most cities
have vacancies similar to or less than those at the
same time last year.

Hobart continues to have the tightest rental market
with a vacancy rate of just 0.4%, while Canberra and
Adelaide both have vacancies a little over 1%.
Melbourne’s vacancy rate was around 2% in
December, the same as a year earlier.

Brisbane’s rate has improved considerably over the
past year, falling from 3.8% to 3.2%, while Perth
vacancies have dropped from 4.6% to 3.4%.

The only city where vacancies are trending to
uncomfortably high levels are Sydney, where they’ve
risen from 2.6% a year ago to 3.6%, and Darwin
which is up from 3.5% to 4.3%.

SQM says the capital city average vacancy rate was
2.5% in December, the same as 12 months earlier.
“<i>The rise in vacancies in December (compared to
November) was due to seasonality</i>,” SQM managing
director Louis Christopher says.
